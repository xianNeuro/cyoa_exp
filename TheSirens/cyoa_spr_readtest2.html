      "Nico first heard the sirens on a Tuesday.",
      "He was walking home past Grantham Hill—the overgrown slope where the old water plant sat behind rusting fences—when the sound cut through the air: one long blare, then three short bursts.",
      "It happened again the next day. Same time. 4:00 p.m. sharp.",
      "No one else seemed to notice. No one talked about it. So Nico told Iris.",
      "“I’ve seen people go in there,” she said. “They never come back. Or they do, and they’re obsessed with water bottles.”",
      "Nico blinked. “You’re not kidding?”",
      "“Dead serious.”",
      "That weekend, they met at the edge of the woods. Nico brought binoculars. Iris brought a flashlight and a taser her cousin wouldn’t miss.",
      "At 3:59 p.m., a tall figure in a trench coat approached the water plant. He typed something on a keypad and walked inside.",
      "Then the sirens blared again.",
      "“I told you,” Nico whispered.",
      "The next day, they brought Finn.",
      "He was skeptical—until he saw the man enter and heard the sirens for himself.",
      "“This is insane,” Finn said. “We’ve lived here our whole lives. How is no one talking about this?”",
      "“Let’s go in,” Iris said.",
      "“What?!” Nico and Finn said together.",
      "“I mean, investigate,” she corrected. “Come on. Don’t you want to know?”",
      "So they made a plan.",
      "Monday: mapped the fence. Found a spot where a tree had fallen over it.",
      "Tuesday: used a shiny kite to distract the security camera.",
      "Wednesday: snuck in.",
      "Inside, the plant was still powered. Red emergency lights lit the hallways. A low buzzing came from somewhere below.",
      "They found a stairwell. The sound got louder.",
      "Downstairs, they found a locked metal door labeled “CHAMBER 4B – DO NOT ENTER.”",
      "They entered.",
      "At the center of the room was a glowing tank. Floating inside was a human-shaped figure—bald, pale, and covered in weird bumps. Its eyes opened.",
      "Nico nearly screamed.",
      "Beside the tank was a file cabinet. Iris grabbed a folder. Inside were photos, names, and memos.",
      "One said:",
      "“Subject 431 shows high stress response to peach stimuli. Recommend containment until Phase III.”",
      "“Peach stimuli?” Finn whispered.",
      "Just then, a speaker crackled above.",
      "“Intruders in Sector 4B. Remain still. Security is on the way.”",
      "They ran.",
      "Back up the stairs. Through the hall. Out the fence.",
      "They didn’t stop until they were safe in Nico’s garage.",
      "The next two days, none of them spoke about it. Then Iris texted:",
      "“Meet at 6 p.m. I’m done keeping this quiet.”",
      "They met behind the diner. Iris brought printed files and a map. Finn had a USB with photos.",
      "They walked into that night’s town hall meeting, sat in the back, and waited.",
      "When public comment opened, Iris stood.",
      "“My name is Iris Lopez. We need to talk about the Grantham Hill facility.”",
      "The mayor raised an eyebrow. “Grantham what?”",
      "Iris handed over the files and photos.",
      "The mayor flipped through them and sighed. “Oh boy. It’s that time of year again.”",
      "Nico leaned forward. “What do you mean?”",
      "The mayor turned on her mic.",
      "“Grantham Hill isn’t a government facility. It was converted five years ago into a student-run acting center by the local arts college. It’s part of their immersive storytelling program.”",
      "Finn’s mouth dropped open.",
      "“The sirens?” Nico asked.",
      "“Sound effects for their games,” the mayor said.",
      "“The guy in the tank?”",
      "“Jeremy. He’s a theater major. Really into sci-fi.”",
      "“The memo about peach reactions?”",
      "“Totally fake,” she said. “Each group writes their own storylines.”",
      "“But the files—”",
      "“Prop documents,” she said with a chuckle. “You kids just wandered into a student LARP set.”",
      "Outside, the three of them stood in stunned silence.",
      "“So…” Finn said slowly, “we didn’t uncover a secret lab.”",
      "“Nope,” Iris said.",
      "“We broke into someone’s drama club project,” Nico groaned.",
      "Then Iris started to laugh.",
      "“I seriously thought we found a government experiment,” she said, wiping her eyes. “I almost sent those files to the press!”",
      "Nico shook his head. “I screamed at an actor in a fish tank.”",
      "Finn pulled out his notebook. “Still writing this down. Future historians will need to know.”",
      "--- The End ---"
